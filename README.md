## How to Build

Quick start (full details, requirements and troubleshooting are in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)):

1. Install Xcode 16 or newer, Homebrew and a Rust toolchain (rustup). On Xcode 27, apply the local changes in
   [XCODE27.md](XCODE27.md) first: it supports macOS 12.0 and newer only, and the project targets 10.13.
2. Clone with submodules:
   ```
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/macosswift/telegram.git
   ```
3. Prepare the machine and build the native libraries once:
   ```
   sh scripts/setup_build_env.sh --build
   ```
4. Open `Telegram-Mac.xcworkspace` in Xcode and build the `Telegram` scheme.
